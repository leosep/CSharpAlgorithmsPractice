# CSharpAlgorithmsPractice

This repository contains a collection of C# algorithms designed for learning and practicing basic to intermediate programming concepts. Each algorithm is implemented with clear comments and explanations.

## List of some Algorithms

1. **Bubble Sort** - Sorts an array by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
2. **Selection Sort** - Selects the smallest element from an unsorted array and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
3. **Insertion Sort** - Builds the final sorted array one item at a time, inserting each item in its correct position.
4. **Merge Two Sorted Arrays** - Merges two sorted arrays into one sorted array.
5. **Quick Sort** - A divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts by partitioning the array around a pivot element.
6. **Find Second Largest Element** - Finds the second largest element in an array.
7. **Find Missing Number** - Finds the missing number in a given sequence.
8. **Prime Number Check** - Determines whether a number is prime or not.
9. **Reverse a String** - Reverses the characters in a string using a two-pointer technique.
10. **Binary Search** - Efficiently searches for a target element in a sorted array.
